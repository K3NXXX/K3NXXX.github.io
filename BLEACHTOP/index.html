                                        series based on Tite Kubo's original manga series of the same name. It was
                                        produced
                                        by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired on TV Tokyo
                                        from
                                        October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the
                                        adventures
                                        of Ichigo Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death
                                        personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia
                                        Kuchiki.
                                        His newfound powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from
                                        evil
                                        spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to adapting the
                                        manga series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original
                                        self-contained
                                        storylines and characters not found in the manga.

                                        Viz Media obtained foreign television and home video distribution rights to the
                                        Bleach anime in March 2006. Bleach was broadcast in the United States on Adult
                                        Swim
                                        from September 2006 to November 2014.

                                        Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War, a sequel series covering the manga's final
                                        story
                                        arc, also animated by Pierrot and directed by Tomohisa Taguchi, aired its first
                                        13-episode cour on TV Tokyo from October to December 2022. The second cour is
                                        set to
                                        premiere in July 2023. Noriyuki Abe was chosen as director of the series while
                                        Masashi Sogo acted as head writer for episodes 1–212. Tsuyoshi Kida was the
                                        head writer for episodes 230–265. Kento Shimoyama held the title of head writer
                                        for episodes #17–366. Masashi Kudō provided the character designs, occasionally
                                        providing key animation or acting as an animation supervisor himself.</p>

                                    <p class="intro_text">The anime has been featured various times in the top ten from
                                        the Japanese TV Ranking. DVDs have also had good sales having
                                        commonly appeared in the Japanese DVD Ranking. The anime was nominated
                                        in the 2007 America Anime Awards in the fields of "best manga", "best actor",
                                        "best DVD package design", and "best theme", but failed to win any
                                        awards. In a 2006 Internet poll by TV Asahi, Bleach was ranked as
                                        Japan's seventh-favorite anime program. The previous year, it was ranked as
                                        the twenty-seventh favorite program. In February 2009, Bleach ranked as the 9th
                                        most viewed animated show from Hulu. Anime News Network's Carlo Santos praised
                                        the anime adaptation, describing it as "...one incredibly entertaining anime
                                        that will grab you and refuse to let go."[94]Animefringe's Maria Lin liked the
                                        varied and distinct characters, and how well they handle the responsibilities
                                        increasing powers give them. She also complimented the series for its attention
                                        to details, well paced script, and balance of seriousness and comedy. In
                                        summary, she notes "Bleach the anime deserves its popularity. It has something
                                        for everyone: the supernatural, comedy, action and a little bit of romance, all
                                        tied together with excellent animation and a very enthusiastic sounding bunch of
                                        voice actors." Adam Arseneau of DVD Verdict, felt Bleach was a "show that only
                                        gets better with age" and was "surprisingly well-rounded and appealing" with
                                        well-developed characters and pacing</p>
