                                            Ulquiorra Cifer (ウルキオラ・シファー, Urukiora Shifā)[2][1] is the Cuatro (4th)
                                            Espada in
                                            Aizen's army of Arrancar.
                                            As a Hollow, Ulquiorra felt alone in the world, being white while those
                                            around
                                            him were black. He wandered Hueco Mundo alone, lamenting his existence,
                                            until
                                            one day he came across a white tree with many sharp spines. Ulquiorra found
                                            it
                                            satisfying due to its emptiness and sank into it, destroying part of his
                                            mask,
                                            finally at peace. An unspecified amount of time later, he was recruited by
                                            Sōsuke Aizen into the Espada.
                                            Ulquiorra is a very cold, callous, and dispassionate figure, and is rather
                                            aloof, brooding, and indifferent, willing to harm his comrades in addition
                                            to
                                            his enemies should they get in his way. He refers to anyone he does not
                                            find
                                            interesting as "trash", and treats them as expendable. Despite this, like
                                            most of the other top Espada, he is not particularly violent, and will only
                                            fight when provoked or ordered to by Aizen.

                                            skillfully keep up with Ichigo's Bankai speed; so fast Ichigo found it hard
                                            to even discern his movements at first. Ulquiorra even managed to

                                            power, Ulquiorra's greatest strength lies in his regenerative power. This
                                            power allows him to regenerate his eye after using his Solita Vista ability.

                                            Murciélago unleashes a black and green burst of spiritual energy, which

                                            affiliated army.</p>
                                        <p class="arrancars__text">Before Grimmjow became an Arrancar, he was a
                                            panther-like Adjuchas-class Menos. At one point he came across a group of
                                            Adjuchas-class Menos that included Shawlong Koufang, Edrad Liones, Yylfordt
                                            Granz, Nakeem Grindina, and Di Roy Rinker. Di Roy decided to eat him, but
                                            before Di Roy could act, Grimmjow attacked him and ate a chunk of Di Roy's
                                            head. The group was impressed at his strength and they introduced
                                            themselves. Their leader Shawlong asked that Grimmjow join them, and the
                                            group bowed to him. Shawlong then explained that they have no intention of
                                            remaining Adjuchas or Gillians, vowing to become Vasto Lorde, but in order
                                            to do that they needed strength that they can use to pull themselves up.
                                            They had seen that strength in Grimmjow and Shawlong asked that Grimmjow
                                            lead them as their king.


                                            Grimmjow with his Hollow companions.

                                            Sometime later, Shawlong told Grimmjow that the group has given up. Yylfordt
                                            explained that they have given up in their quest to evolve into Vasto Lorde.
                                            They had eaten over one thousand Hollows and haven't felt their power
                                            increase anymore. As of that day, they had eaten three thousand so they know
                                            for certain to continue on would be pointless. Grimmjow told them that if
                                            they wanted to give up then it was fine, but he would have nothing to do
                                            with it. Shawlong then asked Grimmjow if he would eat them, and noted that
                                            since Grimmjow had already taken a piece of Di Roy, he would never evolve
                                            into a Vasto Lorde and that in conjunction their evolution would end where
                                            it was at as well. Grimmjow called them cowards, but Shawlong interrupted
                                            him and explained that they have become enlightened. It was not only to the
                                            fact that they would never become Vasto Lorde, but it was something they
                                            knew even before becoming Hollows. They knew that they would always only be
                                            Adjuchas and that Grimmjow would have been the only one to evolve beyond
                                            that stage.</p>

                                            handle are light blue.</p>
                                        <p class="arrancars__text"><span class="arrancars-span-red">Resurrección</span>:
                                            His release command for his Zanpakutō is "Grind" (軋れ, kishire), referring to
                                            grinding one's teeth. To release his Zanpakutō, he holds it up, like the
                                            start of a low sweep stroke, with his right hand. The sword glows light blue
                                            as he puts his left hand up to it. He then rakes his hand along the length
                                            of the blade with a swift motion, while calling out its release command,
                                            which in turn releases a torrent of spiritual power that creates tremendous
                                            gusts of wind in the immediate vicinity. Grimmjow's appearance changes
                                            drastically to something more feline and predatory. His teeth become jagged
                                            and sharp, his hands turn into black claws and his feet become black clawed
                                            paws, similar to that of a cat, along with a slender whip-like tail that's
                                            longer than his body. His hair becomes very long and flowing, and the
                                            markings around his eyes enlarge and extend to the tips of his ears, which
                                            become swept back and cat-like. He loses his distinctive jaw mask, which is
                                            replaced by a sort of a headgear upon his brow covering his forehead. His
                                            clothing changes to become form-fitting white segmented armor, similar to
                                            his original Adjuchas-Hollow form. He has blades protruding from his
                                            forearms and his calves.</p>
                                        <p class="arrancars__text"><span class="arrancars-span-red">Sonic Wave</span>:
                                            When in his released form, he can roar loudly enough to create sonic waves
                                            in the air and surrounding area, which are powerful enough to throw off his
                                            opponents.</p>

                                            fired at high speed from his elbow, five of which can be fired at once. They
                                            have a devastating effect. One round can destroy a column over 30 meters in
                                            diameter.[115] They take the appearance of dark green, crystalline, unevenly
                                            cut stone darts. A Hollow mask-enhanced Ichigo was somewhat able to
                                            withstand 5 of them and continue fighting.</p>

                                            (豹王の爪 (デスガロン), desugaron; Spanish for "Laceration/Great Tear", Japanese for
                                            "Panther King's Claw"): Claimed by Grimmjow himself to be his strongest
                                            attack. His claws glow, and he makes a slashing motion. Each claw
                                            becomes a long, sharp blade composed of Reishi that can be hurled at the
                                            enemy. He can swing a maximum of ten blades at the enemy. The attacks
                                            act as a ranged claw attack, which he controls like his regular claw
                                            attacks, by using slashing motions. The power and force behind them is
                                            considerable, and Ichigo was only able to deflect and shatter them through
                                            sheer force of will.</p>
